## Testing
This document will capture and record the testing complete to ensure functionality of the Canine Coffee website.  A combination of validation testing, using online validator tools, and functional testing will be used.
### Bugs
- Links on navigation bar moving when being hover over. The links should only have a border added. 
- The main logo does not do anything when clicked. It should take you to the home page. 
- No action from form when clicking submit button. There should be feedback to user that this has successfully happened. 
- Incorrect grammar in the why-3, we're barking mad, section of the home page.
- When on reduced screen sizes lines appear in between sections of the footer.
- Default favicon should be replaced with styled favicon.

### HTML Validator Testing

### CSS Validator Testing

### Lighthouse Validator Testing

### Functional Testing

Function testing will be completed against the user stories defined in the README.md. This is to ensure the all desired functionality has been implemented in the final design and code base. If a test fails, it will be recorded as a bug within the bug section of this document. Once fixed that user story will be retested and documented below.
