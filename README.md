# Canine Coffee House - Milestone Project One

This project was complete as part of Code Institute's level 5 web application course. It is a a static front-end project focusing on HTML and CSS technology's and was written by Lyle Kilbey.   

## Overview

This is a web application for coffee shop and restaurant "Canine Coffee". Calling one of brighton's prime dog walking areas, Preston Park, home Canine Coffee aims themselves towards local customers and their furry friends. Offering locally sourced food,  a bespoke doggy menu and a range of coffee and teas Canine Coffee would like build upon their home away from home branding.

The overall purpose of this site is to attract new customers, while also giving existing customers a place to get in contact and stay updated. 

## Design

The design of the site should mimic the soft, homely feel of the Canine Coffee brand. Using Neutral colours and simplistic design to allow users the space to perceive their own feelings home will create unity between experiences online and in-store. 

### User Stories

As Canine Coffee business owner, I want:
- a soft neutral design, to reflect the in-store experience.
- to receive any message from user to my company email, so I do not have to mange an additional inbox.
- the users to know our core values, to reinforce the brand of my business.

As a user, I want: 
- to easily know how to navigate around the website, so I can find the information I am looking for.
- to be able to contact coffee canine, so I can ask questions I need answers to.
- to be able to view the site form any device, so I can use my mobile, tablet or desktop to comfortably view the website.
- to know the what is available to purchase, so I can make an informed decision on if this business is for me.
- to know when the business is open, so I can plan my visit.
- to be able to access the site from any internet connection, so I can look at the website on the go.
- to enjoy the imagery and design of the site, so I feel positive when using the site.

#### Strategy

The vision for this project would be a website which is a hub for a community. Keep it members not only update to date but connected to each other. 

The goal for this section of work towards to above vision, would be to create the foundations of functioning website. With a focus on making a user friendly and intuitive design. 

The Plan: 
- Research and define color palette
- Search and collate images and possible other media
- Create wireframes
- Review and iterate wireframes
- create html and css code base
- test  
- improve initial code base, based on testing results

#### Scope

For users, both new and returning, I want to create a good overview of the canine coffee house brand. Including information on available menus, opening times, and the USPs for canine coffee. I want users of the site to understand the canine coffee is about serving nice food and does not take itself to seriously. The coffee shop should be your home away form home. 

In addition to the above, this project should provide a contact point between the business and their customer base.  

#### Structure

I will follow established UI designs so that the user can intuitively navigate through the site. Using designs and structures like accordions, navigation bars, headers, footers, ect, user should feel that familiar feeling. The design will feature a navigation bar which follows the user through the site, so they can navigate to anywhere on the site from anywhere on the site.  

##### Website sections/pages:
1. Home: A landing page containing the big picture details of canine coffee.
    - 'Why Canine coffee house': A section on the home page contain the three of the most important information on why you should come to canine coffee house.
    - 'Meet The Team': A section with photos and some personal insight into the team members of canine coffee. 
2. Menus: A page containing the menus available from canine coffee.
    - 'Hooman Menu' (Human menu): Containing the dishes available to order which are for human consumption.
    - 'Doggo Menu' (Dog menu): Containing the dishes available to order which are for canine consumption.
    - Drinks: A list of drinks available to purchases.
3. Stay in touch: A page contain the details on how to get in touch with canine coffee
    - About: Contains Contact details, Address, Opening time and Map
    - Send a message: a form to send a message
    - Newsletter sign-up: a form to sign up to a newsletter

#### Skeleton

The website will be designed to be clear and simple. Wireframes will be created using Balsamiq software. Any changes to wireframes will be documented within the dedicated wireframe section of this document.  

#### Surface

I have selected a color pallet which is simple and calm:

![image](assets/wireframes/AdobeColor-Canine%20Coffee%20(1).jpeg)

As the canine coffee targets pets owners, bringing the association of outside and nature reinforces the brand. The Green and brown colours introduce the feeling of trees, forsets, parks, all environments associated with dogs and dog walking. An off-White and charcoal have been included as a foundational color which is familiar and not over stimulating. reinforcing the feeling of the calmness of home and comfortably. 

### Wireframes

The above user stories have been used to create initial wireframes. To aid in assessment of this project, the wireframes have been included within the assets folder. 

####  [Wireframe-v1](/assets/wireframe/wireframe-v1.pdf): 
This is the initial design which was reworked as not all user stories were met.
